				<h4>Moogle Shop</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Items can be bought with jewels.</li>
					<li>Some items can be purchased for a limited time, or via weekly VIP purchase.</li>
				</ul>
				<h4>Passives</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Based off Lux level:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>From level 350, stats (strength, defence, HP, ability gauges) are affected.</li>
						<li>By level 800, strength +3000 (applies to all medals), defence +3000, HP +5000, AG +3 (all Keyblades).</li>
						<li>Passives are added or upgraded every 5 levels from level 350 - 450, every 2 levels from level 450 - 550, and every 1 level from 550+.</li>
					</ul>
					<li>Based off Keyblade level:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>From [Keyblade] +35, passives affect the strength of Upright/Power, Upright/Speed, Upright/Magic, Reverse/Power, Reverse/Speed, Reverse/Magic, Power, Speed, Magic, Upright, and Reverse.</li>
						<li>The passive will only affect the specific medal attribute that matches.</li>
						<li>Examples:</li>
						<ul>
							<li>Upright/Power medal strength +50 => Upright/Power medals</li>
							<li>Power medal strength +100 => ignores Upright or Reverse; Power medals</li>
						</ul>
					</ul>
					<li>Passives can be checked in the 「パッシブ効果」 "Passive Effect" button on your avatar profile.</li>
				</ul>
				<h4>Condensed Medal Fusing</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>The medal fusing/strengthening screen has been updated.</li>
					<li>If you have enough of the appropriate medals, you can max out a medal (strength, defence, cost, etc.) in one go.</li>
					<li style="list-style-type: none">&#8251; The optimize button has been replaced with 「最大強化」 "Maximum Strength". Tapping this will display the new screen.</li>
				</ul>
				<h4>Union Cross Speed</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Speed can now be adjusted like the rest of the game.</li>
					<li>Can now "skip" the rewards screen.</li>
				</ul>
				<h4>Adjusted Subslot Multipliers</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Three-attribute Keyblades have not been changed. The following are compared to them:</li>
					<li>Single-attribute Keyblades: x1.6</li>
					<li>Dual-attribute Keyblades: x1.2</li>
				</ul>
				<h4>Increased Caps</h4>
				<ul>
					<li>Lux level cap is now 850 from 800.</li>
					<li>Max medal storage has been raised from 2000 to 3000.</li>
					<li style="list-style-type: none">In addition, a medal storage sale is being held until October 24 at the time of the data update (usually around 15:00 JST). It costs 50 jewels to expand.</li>
				</ul>
				<h4>Bug Fixes</h4>
				<ul>
					<li style="list-style-type: none">The following have been fixed:</li>
					<li>Raid boss damage is not affected by Reflect properly.</li>
					<li style="list-style-type: none">&#8251; To apologize for the long wait, 3000 jewels have been distributed to all players.</li>
					<li>Some issue with the Beginner Missions.</li>
					<li>The number display on Union rankings were cut off.</li>
				</ul>

				<ul>
					<li>Subslot medals of the same type and tier can be stacked.</li>
					<li style="list-style-type: none">&#8251; Due to this change, these medals cannot be set in the pet slot or as partner.</li>
					<li style="list-style-type: none">&#8251; If the subslot medal fits any of the following conditions, they will not be stacked with the rest:</li>
					<ul>
						<li>The medal has been leveled</li>
						<li>A skill is attached</li>
						<li>Set as a favourite (locked)</li>
					</ul>
					<li style="list-style-type: none">&#8251; If the subslot medal had awakening abilities, it will be stacked with the rest and the awakenings removed.</li>
					<li>The passive effects list has been refined to be easier to read.</li>
					<li>By swiping left or right while viewing a medal allows you to view the previous or following medal.</li>
					<li>Other minor fixes.</li>
